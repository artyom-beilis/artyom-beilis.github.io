# AstroHopper - (f.k.a. SkyHopper)

[AstroHopper](https://artyom-beilis.github.io/astrohopper.html) (formerly known as skyhopper) is a web application that helps
to find objects across the night sky by hopping from a well know and easily identifiable 
star to other fainter stars or DSO by measuring changes in angles of the cell phone
using built in gyroscope and gravity sensors. It is similar to Digital Setting Circles 
implemented in a smart phone.
