<p><a href="https://artyom-beilis.github.io/skyhopper.html">SkyHopper</a> is a web application that helps
to find objects across the night sky by hopping from a well know and easily identifiable 
star to other fainter stars or DSO by measuring changes in angles of the cell phone
using built in gyroscope and gravity sensors. It is similar to Digital Setting Circles 
implemented in a smart phone.</p>
<p>The smart phone has to have gyro, gravity sensors and preferably compass.</p>
<p>It is a web based application that contains a single HTML page and JavaScript objects 
database that will continue working even offline as long as it is cached by a browser.</p>
<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<p>You attach the cellphone to the telescope such that the physical <strong>top</strong> part of the phone 
points towards viewing direction. Note it is different from typical sky observing apps
that simulate camera view of the sky. For this application the screen is parallel to the
viewing direction.</p>
<p>Before you attach the smartphone, open the application and calibrate the compass using "8" like movements. The calibration will significantly improve compass direction accuracy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Align your telescope with an easily identifiable star or a planet near the object you want to observe</li>
<li>Tap on <code>Align</code> button </li>
<li>Tap on the star or the planet you selected. 3s timer is started to make sure there is no shaking. After 3 seconds the application is aligned on the selected object. "Aligned" message is shown and a cross that represents the direction your telescope is looking to is shown in the center of the screen.</li>
<li>Tap on an object you want to observe and you get a line showing a direction you need to move the telescope to and the changes in altitude and azimuth are shown at the right and bottom part of the screen</li>
<li>Move the telescope till these numbers are close to zero - at this point your telescope should point to the requested object</li>
<li>In order to move to next object - repeat the alignment process from the step 1 since the builtin cellphone gyros don't keep the accuracy for a long time/multiple movements</li>
</ol>
<p>Here you can find a demonstration video: <a href="https://youtu.be/3VXCSMidhe0">https://youtu.be/3VXCSMidhe0</a></p>
<h2 id="notes-for-ios-users">Notes for iOS Users</h2>
<ul>
<li>For iOS 13.0 and above you need to allow access to device orientation information by pressing <code>Enable Device Orientation</code> button once application loads</li>
<li>For iOS 12.2 and before 13 you need to allow access via: <em>Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Motion and Orientation access</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The sky in application look different from what I expect?</em></p>
<p>Make sure your browser provided location information. If it is not "No Geolocation" message will be shown. Check the geographica coordinates in settings menu to make sure they match your location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I move the phone but nothing moves?</em></p>
<p>Make sure your cellphone has working sensors. Does SkyMap like applications work for you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I move the application but only Altitude is changing. Azimuth is poining to Polaris/North?</em></p>
<p>Your browser may not support compass heading (for example Firefox) or you don't have such a sensor in the phone.
You can adjust azimuth manually by swipping the screen till you get required azimuth and then align.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I pointed my telescope to a star but the cell phone seems to point to a different direction?</em></p>
<p>The compass of the cell phone may be significantly misaligned you may to do following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move your cell phone in compass calibration/waving pattern to increase compass accuracy</li>
<li>Increase application's field of view by pressing <code>+</code> at the top left corner near value <code>∠60°</code> - default FOV.</li>
<li>You may switch to manual azimuth mode by pressing "hand" <code>✋</code> icon at the right side and adjust the azimuth manually</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The screen becomes dim very fast and I don't have time to align/point the telescope?</em></p>
<p>Modify the "sleeping" settings for the cell phone. It is under "Settings -&gt; Display" in Android</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I start moving the telescope to modify azimuth direction but according to the application it stopped moving, or going back - behaves strangly?</em></p>
<p>It seems that gyro lost accuracy. It happens. Try again. If it still happens all the time and you can't reach the target. Try one of following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a start that is closer on its azimuth to target object - altitude has much more accurate tracking.</li>
<li>Correct altitude first and than search for the object on azimuth axis </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="watch-list">Watch List</h2>
<p>A user can create a custom watch list in advance to browse them easily during the night.
There is <code>List</code> option in "Settings" menu.  It has  <code>[edit]</code> control to open watch list editing tool/</p>
<p>A watch list is defined by a simple list of object names separated by space, new lines or commas. 
For example below the "default" list:</p>
<pre><code>M411, M47, M49, M50, M44, M45
</code></pre>
<p>Several named lists can be defined by giving watch list a name followed by <code>:</code>:</p>
<pre><code>clusters: M41 M47 M49
 M50 M44 M45
dbstars: Polaris, "Cor Caroli"
</code></pre>
<p>Lists can be selected by pressing <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> buttons in "Lists" control. When the list is selected two buttons <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> are shown in main screen under "Align" button. They allow browsing the objects forward and backward. The current selected object's name is shown under the conrols.</p>
<p>The watch lists are stored at your phone on per domain basis. They are kept even when you reopen the app. </p>
<p><em>Note:</em> if you accessing the app from different location (for example from local server) than it is stored saparetly, so prepare the list in advance.</p>
<h2 id="user-objects">User Objects</h2>
<p>This application does not contain every possible star or DSO. If you want to access objects that are not listed in the database you can add them via "User Objects" in settings menu.</p>
<p>User object are defined in CSV format when first column contains object name, second right ascension (RA) and the third the declination (DEC).
Both RA and DEC can be given as decimal degrees (0-360 for RA and -90 +90 for DEC) or in hour/degree with minutes and seconds. Seconds may be omitted. Fields can be separated by spaces, by ":" or by apropriate symbols like "h", "m", "s", "d". For example </p>
<ul>
<li>RA: <code>170.6358</code>, <code>11:22:32.6</code>, <code>11h 22m 32.6s</code>, <code>11h 22' 32.6''</code>, <code>11 22′ 32.6″</code>, <code>11 22 32.6</code>, <code>11:32</code></li>
<li>DEC: <code>-87.3757</code>, <code>-87:22:32.6</code>, <code>-87d 22m 32.6s</code>, <code>-87d 22' 32.6''</code>, <code>-87° 22′ 32.6″</code>, <code>-87 22 32.6</code>, <code>-87:22</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This is an example of such a list:</p>
<pre><code>V1405,23h 24m 48s, +61° 11′ 15″
Pluto,19:55:16,-22:13:42
</code></pre>
<p>The user objects are stored on your phone on per domain basis. They are kept even when you reopen the app. </p>
<p><em>Note:</em> if you accessing the app from different location (for example from local server) than it is stored separetly, so prepare the list in advance.</p>
<h2 id="equatorial-mount-users">Equatorial Mount Users</h2>
<p>The application assumes you work with alt-azimuth mount. If you are using equatorial mount an additional error may be introduced due to misalignment between the cell phone major axis and the telescope axis.</p>
<p>If the targets are close to poles and significant changes in right ascension are required for the hop any misalignment error between cell phone axis and telescope axis will affect the accuracy. Final error can be calculated as 2e⋅sin(Δα/2)⋅sin(δ), where e - misalignment error between cell phone and telescope, Δα - change in right ascension required for the hop and δ - declination of the target.</p>
<p>So it may not work reliably for equatorial mounts. Alt-Az mounts are recommended.</p>
<h2 id="road-map">Road Map</h2>
<ol>
<li>Develop procedure for phone alignment for equatorial mounts.</li>
<li>Implement zoom-via-pinch.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>On some iPad versions (iOS 12.5) the star/target selection does not work</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="serving-skyhopper-of-remote-location">Serving SkyHopper of remote location</h2>
<p>At remote locations internet isn't always present. SkyHopper provides simple web server written in python3 to serve the SkyHopper over LAN. You can setup it on any device that can run python 3.</p>
<p>This is how you can serve it from an Android phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install termux, you need to use F-Droid package manager: <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/">https://www.f-droid.org/</a>, the version avalible from Google Store is not getting updates and at this point it is impossible to install python there:</li>
<li>
<p>Install python withing termux:</p>
<pre><code>apt update
pkg install python
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide termux access to storage by running:</p>
<pre><code>termux-setup-storage
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download a copy of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artyom-beilis/artyom-beilis.github.io/master/skyhopper.py">skyhopper.py</a> to a location accessible by termux, for this manual it will be <code>Downloads</code></p>
</li>
<li>Run python script from there:<pre><code>cd /storage/emulated/0/Downloads
python skyhopper.py
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can close the server by simply pressing <code>Ctrl+C</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Now you can go to <a href="https://127.0.0.1:8443/">https://127.0.0.1:8443/</a> address in the browser and use it.  Please note <code>https</code> protocol and <code>8443</code> port</li>
<li>Note since it uses self-signed SSL certificate you will have to give a security exception when accessing this site</li>
<li>If you want to serve the skyhopper to other users at your pysical location:<ul>
<li>Create "hotspot", the typical gateway of android hotspot is <code>192.168.43.1</code></li>
<li>Run skyhopper as described before <em>after</em> you created hotspot</li>
<li>Now you can go to <a href="https://192.168.43.1:8443/">https://192.168.43.1:8443/</a> from any device connected to the hotspot and open skyhopper there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
